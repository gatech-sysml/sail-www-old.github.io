I am a second year MS in ECE student at Georgia Tech. At SAIL, I'm working on reducing the inference latency of deep neural networks as a part of the Learned Caches project. Broadly, my interests lie in the areas of systems for deep learning, computer vision and efficient deep neural networks for embedded systems.
