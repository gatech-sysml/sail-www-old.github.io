I am a PhD student working with Prof. Chao Zhang and Prof. Alexey Tumanov on Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology. My research focus on developing cutting-edge ML/DL algorithms learning from multi-modal time series data to make robust individualized predictions and recommendations for decision making. My research topics include but are not limited to Time Series Analysis, Deep Modeling, (Non-parametric) Bayesian Modeling, Causal Inference and their applications to healthcare.
